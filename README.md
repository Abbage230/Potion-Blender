## How to use

### 1 - Cauldron

First, you need to make a special cauldron. Do so by right-clicking a campfire with a vanilla cauldron.

### 2 - Starting to blend

Then,throw a potion in the cauldron. It can be any vanilla potion that is not splash or lingering. This will be the base of your combined potion. You can then add up to two more potions (neither splash or lingering) to add their effects to the final product

### 3 - The final ingredient

Now it is time to finish the brewing, and choose the type of potion you so desire. You may choose one of three of these ingredients :
- - Nether wart -> Normal potion
- - Gunpowder -> Splash potion
- - Dragon Breath -> Lingering potion

### 4 - Using arrows

The combined potions can be used with arrows using the vanilla craft to add the combined effects to the arrows

### 5 - Cancelling the blend

You can reset the cauldron at any time by right clicking on the special cauldron to get back your ingredients.

## Configuration
The configuration file is located in your .minecraft folder at potionblender/potion_blender_config.json

The configurable options are:
- max_effects: The maximum number of potions in a cauldron. Be careful when updating this value in an already existing world as it may cause desync on already placed cauldron.
